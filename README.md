## Dotfiles
![](/rice.png)

This is my personal collection of dotfiles for my Dell XPS 15 9570 running Bedrock Linux.

I've been searching for a distro for what seems like forever now, and finally I feel like I've found the perfect one for me.
Before I turned this into a Bedrock system, it was running Void linux (musl), which while I loved, made it very hard/impossible to install certain pieces of software.
While I could have easily switched back to Arch, I loved how fast and simple Void's runit and XBPS were.  Now I found a way to get the best of both worlds.

Since this was originally a Void system, I still get to take advantage of the lightweight system and the extreme speed of runit, xbps, and musl. 
While this alone is one of the favorite distro's I've tried, thanks to the guys at Bedrock Linux, I still have access to the huge package repos of Arch and the AUR.
This has made installing proprietary and/or glibc-only software extremely convenient, so I decided to put the time into setting it up just the way I like it.

Here is some info about my setup:

+ **WM**: [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
+ **OS**: [Bedrock Linux](http://bedrocklinux.org/) --> [more details below](#Bedrock)
+ **Shell**: [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh)
+ **Terminal**: [st](https://st.suckless.org/)
